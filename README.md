# personal-projects
These are small projects I've made to learn certain languages, tools, and other nicknacks for programming.

-----------------------------

Year 1
- Most java projects I've built during year 1 of college. Relatively small and simple with short scopes. Not entirely efficient or up to standard.

Year 2
- Java projects I've worked on during year 2 of college. Better than before, with still that tinge of a beginner starting out with coding.
